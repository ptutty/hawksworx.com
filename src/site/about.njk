    This site is the online home of Phil Tutty. He doesn't love talking about himself in the third person, so he's going to stop that now if you don't mind.

<h2 id="about-me">ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for stopping by</h2>
<p>
  I have been building things on the web professionally for almost 20 years. Between 2009 and 2018 that happened at agencies where I was fortunate to work with a wide range of public and private sector clients.

  I live in the English city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Albans">Coventry</a>, just a 100 miles north of London with my wife and our 2 kids
