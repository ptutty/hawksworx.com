I completed my fifth half marathon, and my third [Coventry Half Marathon](https://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/coventry-news/coventry-half-marathon-photos-video-16019717)  on Sunday . It wasn't pretty as I was coming down with the flu and had headache and dizziness most the way around. I decided the best approach would be to take the pace down a little and just grind down the miles and 'embrace' the discomfort. I managed a time of 1hr 51mins, not my best time but did learn I've become mentally stronger since my first couple of half-marathons.
